I love seeing people I havent seen in awhile on Eid. Unfortunately, Im not a kid so all my aunties and uncles aren&#39;t gonna slip me a 20 lol. Eid Mubarak!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/somaliansilver"> /u/somaliansilver </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/bwkjz6/happy_eid_to_all_those_celebrating_today/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/bwkjz6/happy_eid_to_all_those_celebrating_today/">[comments]</a></span>
