<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I overheard two conversations about me. Though I never actually heard my name, I don&#39;t know what else they would be talking about.</p> <p>One conversation was talking about how they needed to &quot;get him on track&quot; and &quot;he needs to stop wasting time&quot;. One coworker then said that he &quot;got him set up on the (Todo list software) so that should help&quot; and &quot;he meets with (my manager) on Thursday&quot;. Since I&#39;m a new hire I got set up on the Todo list software last week when I started, and I meet with my manager on Thursday. </p> <p>Then, I&#39;m leaving for the day, going down the stairs. I overheard my manager talking to the lab tech, saying something about &quot;he needs to learn how to be more self sufficient&quot; and &quot;he needs to try more&quot;.</p> <p>I&#39;m absolutely crushed here. This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve had bosses talk shit about me. But the thing is, I&#39;m really trying my hardest at this job. It&#39;s at a rather demanding well known company, I&#39;m working as an engineering intern.</p> <p>The subject matter is something I&#39;m actually interested in, so I can&#39;t see any motivational or terrible concentration issues in myself. I thought I was doing a good job so far, until today. </p> <p>I&#39;m really sad and I don&#39;t know what to do. I see my manager on Thursday for our weekly one on one meetings. I don&#39;t know if I should bring it up sooner, or wait until then. It&#39;s going to be hard to focus and to a good job knowing I&#39;m being talked about, though.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/piecat"> /u/piecat </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwnqjc/second_week_in_my_internship_and_theyre_already/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwnqjc/second_week_in_my_internship_and_theyre_already/">[comments]</a></span>
