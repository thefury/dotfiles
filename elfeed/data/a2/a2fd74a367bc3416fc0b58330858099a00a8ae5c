<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone have any success stories? you&#39;ve found your niche? doing something fulfilling that you love? </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I&#39;m on the verge of dropping out of university for around the 5th time in my life and I&#39;m feeling really down about it. I&#39;ve always been extremely ambitious and the idea of getting a degree has been really important to me for my entire life, but I&#39;ve never found anything that I&#39;ve been able to stick to. Everything I&#39;ve tried has left me feeling like a complete and utter stupid failure. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I know I&#39;m not stupid, but I can&#39;t focus my energy where it needs to go so I&#39;m always left feeling and seeming like I am. After being diagnosed with ADHD I&#39;ve been re-evaluating my options, trying to come to terms with the fact that university might not be for me and that I should explore other avenues, but I&#39;m just fundamentally discouraged. I want to do amazing things in life but I&#39;m so far behind and can&#39;t get there no matter how hard I try.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Does anyone have any links to anything inspiring? I watched Jessica McCabes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwZQNYlGQI">ted talk</a> which I really enjoyed and it made me feel a little better, but not all of us can be youtubers. Does anyone have any personal success stories? Links to other stories/videos of other ADHDers who are living their truth? I really need some kind of hope and guidance right now. Thank you xx</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sapphocherry"> /u/sapphocherry </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwpzmu/adhd_success_stories/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwpzmu/adhd_success_stories/">[comments]</a></span>
