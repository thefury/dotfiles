<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This morning at about 5:45am I&#39;m driving up Oakwood toward Eglinton making my way to the Allen when I see something hanging from the gantry crane at the crosstown construction site at the end of Oakwood. My thoughts go from &quot;hey that looks like a body&quot; to &quot;is that a fuckin body?&quot; to &quot;Jesus fucking Christ somebody hung themselves&quot;. What followed was a feeling that ive never felt before, a mixture of sickness and panic and cold sweat. As I come to the intersection I realize its a fucking dummy dressed in construction gear hanging from a chain about 15 ft off the ground with 3 workers standing around it drinking coffee. A sense of great relief washed over me followed by anger. What the fuck was that? I can only assume it was some sort of a prank? Am i overreacting? Is this as fucked up as i feel it is. My first thoughts went to my buddy who hung himself a few years back and how a member of his family would have felt had they come across this scene.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dougietheturtle"> /u/dougietheturtle </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/bwnqhg/suicide_prankquestion_mark_at_oakwood_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/bwnqhg/suicide_prankquestion_mark_at_oakwood_and/">[comments]</a></span>
