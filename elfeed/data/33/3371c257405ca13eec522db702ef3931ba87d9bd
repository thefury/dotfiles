<p>AWS Solutions Architects are on the front line of helping customers succeed using our technologies. Our team members leverage their deep knowledge of AWS technologies to build custom solutions that solve specific problems for clients. But many customers want to solve common technical problems that don’t require custom solutions, or they want a general solution they can use as a reference to build their own custom solution. For these customers, we offer <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/">AWS Solutions</a>: vetted, technical reference implementations built by AWS Solutions Architects and AWS Partner Network partners. AWS Solutions are designed to help customers solve common business and technical problems, or they can be customized for specific use cases.</p> 
<p>AWS Solutions are built to be operationally effective, performant, reliable, secure, and cost-effective; and incorporate architectural frameworks such as the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/">Well-Architected Framework</a>. Every AWS Solution comes with a detailed architecture diagram, a deployment guide, and instructions for both manual and automated deployment.</p> 
<p>Here are some Solutions we are particularly excited about.</p> 
<h2>Media2Cloud</h2> 
<p>We released the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/media2cloud">Media2Cloud</a> solution in January 2019. This solution helps customers migrate their existing video archives to the cloud. Media2Cloud sets up a serverless end-to-end workflow to ingest your videos and establish metadata, proxy videos, and image thumbnails.</p> 
<p>Because it can be a challenging and slow process to migrate your existing video archives to the cloud, the Media2Cloud solution builds the following architecture.</p>

<p>The solution leverages the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/media-entertainment/media-analysis-solution/">Media Analysis Solution</a> to analyze and extract valuable metadata from your video archives using Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Transcribe, and Amazon Comprehend.</p> 
<p>The solution also includes a simple web interface that helps make it easier to get started ingesting your videos to the AWS Cloud. This solution is set up to integrate with AWS Partner Network partners to help customers migrate their video archives to the cloud.</p> 
<h2>AWS Instance Scheduler</h2> 
<p>In October 2018, we updated the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/instance-scheduler">AWS Instance Scheduler</a>, a solution that enables customers to easily configure custom start and stop schedules for their Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS instances.</p> 
<p>When you deploy the solution’s template, the solution builds the following architecture.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1048" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2019/02/13/solution-launch-instance.png" alt="AWS Instance Scheduler" width="366" height="191" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For customers who leave all of their instances running at full utilization, this solution can result in up to 70% cost savings for those instances that are only necessary during regular business.</p> 
<p>The Instance Scheduler solution gives you the flexibility to automatically manage multiple schedules as necessary, configure multiple start and stop schedules by either deploying multiple Instance Schedulers or modifying individual resource tags, and review Instance Scheduler metrics to better assess your Instance capacity and usage, and to calculate your cost savings.</p> 
<h2>AWS Connected Vehicle Solution</h2> 
<p>In January 2018, we updated the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-connected-vehicle-solution">AWS Connected Vehicle Solution</a>, a solution that provides secure vehicle connectivity to the AWS Cloud. This solution includes capabilities for local computing within vehicles, sophisticated event rules, and data processing and storage. The solution also allows you to implement a core framework for connected vehicle services that allows you to focus on developing new functionality rather than managing infrastructure.</p> 
<p>When you deploy the solution’s template, the solution builds the following architecture.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1050" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2019/02/13/solution-launch-vehicle.png" alt="Connected Vehicle solution" width="369" height="317" /></p> 
<p>You can build upon this framework to address a variety of use cases such as voice interaction, navigation and other location-based services, remote vehicle diagnostics and health monitoring, predictive analytics and required maintenance alerts, media streaming services, vehicle safety and security services, head unit applications, and mobile applications.</p> 
<p>These are just some of our current offerings. Other notable Solutions include <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-waf-security-automations/">AWS WAF Security Automations</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/machine-learning-for-telecommunication/">Machine Learning for Telecommunication</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/aws-landing-zone">AWS Landing Zone</a>. In the coming months, we plan to continue expanding our portfolio of AWS Solutions to address common business and technical problems that our customers face.
