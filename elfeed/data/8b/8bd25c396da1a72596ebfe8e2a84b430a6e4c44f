<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even know where to start. I have been diagnosed and medicated for over 6 years. Consistent dose, my life was good, I could function. I was suprised with an accidental pregnancy in January, and was immediately taken off my medicine. My doctor that has been my doctor since a child didnt even stay in the appointment for more than 10 minutes. She just said there was no way she would prescribe me my vyvanse pregnant. I held back the fear and melt down then, flash forward to now, at 22 weeks. I lost my job, I can&#39;t find another job this pregnant that will take me serious for a few months before maternity leave, and just staying at home trying to do tasks such as laundry take me an entire day. Things with my baby&#39;s father are all fine, I have my own father helping with my bills while I&#39;m down jobless, but I have never in my life felt like such a worthless waste of space. I can&#39;t do anything constructive with my broken brain. I am laying in my bed currently on laundry I&#39;ve been working on since 9am bawling. I can&#39;t even do laundry. How am I supposed to just continue to suffer through another 20 weeks of pregnancy like this. I want to lay in bed and just never leave it. I just want to be my old functioning self. Please any suggestions to make it through or encouraging words are so needed. I love my baby so much, but this is making me resent pregnancy and never want to do this again.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bohdeka"> /u/bohdeka </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwrofj/pregnant_unmedicated_slipping_fast/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwrofj/pregnant_unmedicated_slipping_fast/">[comments]</a></span>
