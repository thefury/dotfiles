In some cases, trust is built up over an extended period of time, reinforced with each successful transaction and seen as an integral part of the relationship. In other situations, there’s no time to accumulate trust and other mechanisms must be used instead. The parties must find a way to successfully complete the transaction in the absence of trust. Today, emerging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> technologies such as <a href="http://Hyperledger Fabric">Hyperledger Fabric</a> and <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> fill this important need, allowing parties to come to consensus regarding the validity of a proposed transaction and create an unalterable digital record (commonly known as a ledger) of each transaction in the absence of trust.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Amazon Managed Blockchain</strong></span><br /> We <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-previews-and-pre-announcements-at-reinvent-2018-andy-jassy-keynote/">announced</a> Amazon Managed Blockchain at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> 2018 and invited you to sign up for a preview. I am happy to announce that the preview is complete and that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/" title="">Amazon Managed Blockchain</a> is now available for production use in the <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span> Region. You can use it to create scalable blockchain networks that use the Hyperledger Fabric open source framework, with Ethereum in the works. As you will see in a minute, you can create your network in minutes. Once created, you can easily manage and maintain your blockchain network. You can manage certificates, invite new members, and scale out peer node capacity in order to process transactions more quickly.</p> 
<p>The blockchain networks that you create with <span title="">Amazon Managed Blockchain</span> can span multiple AWS accounts so that a group of members can execute transactions and share data without a central authority. New members can easily launch and configure peer nodes that process transaction requests and store a copy of the ledger.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Using Amazon Managed Blockchain</strong></span><br /> I can create my own scalable blockchain network from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> (<code>aws managedblockchain create-network</code>), or API (<code class="lang-xml"><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/latest/APIReference/API_CreateNetwork.html">CreateNetwork</a></code>). To get started, I open the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/managedblockchain/home?region=us-east-1#firstRun">Amazon Managed Blockchain Console</a> and click <strong>Create a network</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_con_main_1.png" width="800" height="701" /></p> 
<p>I need to choose the edition (Starter or Standard) for my network. The Starter Edition is designed for test networks and small production networks, with a maximum of 5 members per network and 2 peer nodes per member. The Standard Edition is designed for scalable production use, with up to 14 members per network and 3 peer nodes per member (check out the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/pricing/">Amazon Managed Blockchain Pricing</a> to learn more about both editions). I also enter a name and a description for my network:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_create_p1_1.png" width="900" height="852" /></p> 
<p>Then I establish the voting policy for my network, and click <strong>Next</strong> to move ahead (read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/latest/managementguide/managed-blockchain-proposals.html">Work with Proposals</a> to learn more about creating and voting on proposals):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_create_p2_1.png" width="900" height="353" /></p> 
<p>Now, I need to create the first member of my network. Each member is a distinct identity within the network, and is visible within the network. I also set up a user name and password for my certificate authority, and click <strong>Next</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_create_member_cert_1.png" width="900" height="824" /></p> 
<p>I review my choices, and click <strong>Create network and member</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_go_create_1.png" width="900" height="659" /></p> 
<p>My network enters the <strong>Creating</strong> status, and I take a quick break to walk my dog! When I return, my network is <strong>Available</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_available_1.png" width="900" height="332" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Inviting Members</strong></span><br /> Now that my network is available, I can invite members by clicking the <strong>Members</strong> tab:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_details_1.png" width="900" height="511" /></p> 
<p>I can see the current members of my network, both those I own and those owned by others. I click on <strong>Propose invitation</strong> to invite a new member:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_members_1.png" width="900" height="740" /></p> 
<p>Then I enter the AWS account number of the proposed member and click <strong>Create</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_invite_1.png" width="900" height="711" /></p> 
<p>This creates a proposal (visible to me and to the other members of the network). I click on the ID to proceed:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_proposals_1.png" width="900" height="737" /></p> 
<p>I review the proposal, select my identity (<strong>block-wizard</strong>), and then click <strong>Yes</strong> to vote:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_i_voted_1.png" width="900" height="928" /></p> 
<p>After enough <strong>Yes</strong> votes have been received to pass the threshold that I specified when I created the network, the invitation will be extended to the new member, and will be visible in the <strong>Invitations</strong> section:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_invites_2.png" width="510" height="305" /></p> 
<p>If you are building a blockchain network for testing purposes and don’t have access to multiple AWS accounts, you can even invite your own account. After you do this (and vote to let yourself in), you will end up with multiple members in the same account.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Using the Network</strong></span><br /> Now that the network is running, and has some members, the next step is to create an endpoint in the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) where I will run my blockchain applications (this feature is powered by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/">AWS PrivateLink</a>). Starting from the detail page for my network, I click <strong>Create VPC endpoint</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_details2_1.png" width="900" height="585" /></p> 
<p>I choose the desired VPC and the subnets within it, pick a security group, and click <strong>Create</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_create_vpc_endpoint_1.png" width="690" height="765" /></p> 
<p>My applications can use the VPC endpoint to communicate with my blockchain network:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/amb_endpoint_1.png" width="350" height="514" /></p> 
<p>The next step is to build applications that make use of the blockchain.
