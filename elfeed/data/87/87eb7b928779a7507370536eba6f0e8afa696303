<h2>Getting started</h2> 
<p>ML Insights is only available on the Enterprise Edition of Amazon QuickSight. If you are using the Standard Edition, you can easily upgrade with 1-click on the Manage QuickSight page.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compare Editions</a></li> 
 <li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/upgrading-subscription.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upgrading Your Amazon QuickSight Subscription from Standard Edition to Enterprise Edition</a></li> 
</ul> 
<p>To get started with ML Insights, you’ll need to connect a data source to Amazon QuickSight. Data sets can be accessed by direct query to the SQL-compatible database source or by using SPICE.</p> 
<p>For this walkthrough, your data must have the following properties:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>At least one date field.</li> 
 <li>At least one metric, such as sales, orders, shipped units, or sign ups.</li> 
 <li>At least one category dimension, such as product, channel, segment, or industry.</li> 
 <li>More than 40 historical data points per metric.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For optimal results, make sure that your data set has enough historical data points. The built-in ML algorithm requires at least 40 historical data points to learn and train the model, and it will use up to the most recent 1,000 data points. For example, if you’re analyzing daily sales by geographic region, make sure that you have at least 40 days of data. Three months to twelve months of data is preferred, depending on the seasonality of your business</p> 
<p>You can use your own data set, or you can download the following sample data set. We’ll use this dataset for the walkthrough:</p> 
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/quicksight-ml-insights/ML-Insights-Sample-Dataset-V1.csv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://s3.amazonaws.com/quicksight-ml-insights/ML-Insights-Sample-Dataset-V1.csv</a></p> 
<p>Once you have created a data set in Amazon QuickSight, create a new analysis from the data set. For more information about creating data sets and analyses in Amazon QuickSight, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon QuickSight User Guide</a>.</p> 
<h2>Suggested insights</h2> 
<p>ML Insights automatically interprets your data and provides contextual insights called suggested insights. Different visuals may result in different types of insights. For example, if you have a time-series visual, you may get insights such as period-over-period changes, anomalies, and forecasts.</p> 
<p>Let’s walk through an example.</p> 
<p>1. Create a line chart with a metric and a date, such as revenue over time, aggregated daily.</p> 
<p>2. Choose<strong> Insights</strong> in the top left-hand corner of the visual.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6627" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS1-1.png" alt="" width="800" height="467" /></p> 
<p>You should then see a list of suggested insights on the left pane. Suggested insights provide you with a quick summary of the data in plain language. As you add visuals to your analyses, you will see additional suggested insights on the left pane, grouped by the visual name.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6628" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS2.png" alt="" width="800" height="453" /></p> 
<p>You can choose a suggested insight such as <strong>day over day change</strong> to highlight the data point or segment on the visual. Choose it again to deselect it.</p> 
<h2>ML-powered anomaly detection</h2> 
<p>With ML Insights, you can run ML-powered anomaly detection on up to a million metrics simultaneously to discover hidden trends and outliers that are often buried in aggregates. To learn more about pricing for anomaly detection, go to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon QuickSight pricing</a> and choose <strong>ML Insights</strong>.</p> 
<p>Let’s get started with anomaly detection.</p> 
<p>1. Choose<strong> Add</strong> on the application bar, and then choose <strong>Add anomaly to sheet</strong>. This creates an insights visual for anomaly detection.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6629" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS3.png" alt="" width="350" height="129" /></p> 
<p>2. Expand the field wells on the top of the page and add at least one category field.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6630" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS4.png" alt="" width="800" height="412" /></p> 
<p>The categories represent the dimensional values by which Amazon QuickSight will split the metric. For example, let’s say you are analyzing anomalies in revenue across all product categories and product SKUs. Assuming there are 10 product categories, each with 10 product SKUs, Amazon QuickSight will split the metric by the 100 unique combinations and run anomaly detection on each of the split metrics.</p> 
<p>3. Choose <strong>Get Started</strong> on the insights visual to configure the anomaly detection job.</p> 
<p>4. On the anomaly detection configuration pane, configure the following options:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Analyze all combinations of these categories</strong> – If you select three categories, Amazon QuickSight will run anomaly detection on the following combinations, hierarchically: A, AB, ABC. If you select this option, Amazon QuickSight will analyze all combinations, including: A, AB, ABC, BC, AC. If your data is not hierarchical, you should select this option.</li> 
 <li><strong>Number of anomalies to show</strong> – This setting allows you to control the number of top anomalies you want to display on the insights cards as narratives.</li> 
 <li><strong>Schedule – </strong>Set the schedule to run anomaly detection on your data hourly, daily, weekly or monthly, depending on your data. Choose the start time and the time zone of the start time.</li> 
 <li><strong>Contribution analysis</strong> – You can select up to four additional dimensions for Amazon QuickSight to analyze for top contributors when an anomaly is detected. For example, Amazon QuickSight can show you the top customers that contributed to a spike in sales in the USA for Home Improvement products. If you have additional dimensions in your data (dimensions not used in the anomaly detection), you can add them here for contribution analysis. For this example, choose the <strong>Geo</strong> for contribution analysis.</li> 
</ul> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6631" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS5.png" alt="" width="800" height="1060" /></p> 
<p>5. Choose<strong> OK. </strong>Amazon QuickSight will not implement the schedule until you publish the analysis as a dashboard. Within an analysis, you will have the option to run anomaly detection manually without the schedule.</p> 
<p>6. After the configuration is set, choose <strong>Run Now</strong> to run detection manually. You will see a “Analyzing for anomalies… This may take a while…” message. Depending on the size of your data set, analysis may take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6632" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS6.png" alt="" width="800" height="159" /></p> 
<p>Once anomaly detection is complete, you will see the top anomalies for the latest period in your data listed in the insights visual. Amazon QuickSight also computes and displays the expected value so you can better understand the significance of the anomaly.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6633" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS7.png" alt="" width="800" height="214" /></p> 
<p>7. To see all anomalies for this data, choose the selector in the upper right of the visual and choose <strong>Explore Anomalies</strong>.</p> 
<p>On the detailed anomalies page, you can see all of the anomalies detected for the latest period. The title of the visual represents the metric that is applied to the unique combination of the categorical fields. The highlighted data point on the chart—on the far right of the chart—represents the most recent anomaly detected for that time series.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6634" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS8.png" alt="" width="800" height="248" /></p> 
<p>On the left pane, you will see the top contributors to the anomaly based on the dimensions you have predefined. When you hover over the top contributors, Amazon QuickSight displays an explanation of the significance of the contribution.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6635" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS9.png" alt="" width="800" height="239" /></p> 
<p>8. To see anomalies by date, choose <strong>Show Anomalies by Date</strong> from the top of the visual to expose a date picker. The cart will display the number of anomalies detected for each unit of your anomaly detection configuration. You can choose a particular date to see the anomalies for that date. For example, if you choose Nov. 1st, 2018, from the graph, then the bar chart highlights the anomalies for that date.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6636" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS10.png" alt="" width="800" height="458" /></p> 
<p><strong>Important: </strong>Amazon QuickSight uses the first 40 data points in a data set for training; these data points will not be scored by the anomaly detection algorithm. You may not see any anomalies on the first 40 data points.</p> 
<p>9. Use the filter controls at the top of the pane to change the anomaly threshold to show anomalies with <strong>high, medium </strong>or<strong> low</strong> significance or to show only anomalies that are <strong>higher than expected</strong> or <strong>lower than expected</strong>. You can also filter by the categorical values that are present in your data set to look at anomalies only for those categories.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6637" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS11.png" alt="" width="800" height="277" /></p> 
<p>10. To go back to your analysis, choose <strong>Back to analysis</strong> at the top of the page.</p> 
<h2>ML-powered forecasting</h2> 
<p>Using the built-in ML algorithm, you can now forecast business metrics with point-and-click simplicity without having to write code or build a complex spreadsheet.</p> 
<p>1. On your time series chart, choose the selector in the upper right corner of the visual, and then choose <strong>Add forecast</strong>. Amazon QuickSight will analyze the historical data using ML and present a forecast for the next 14 periods.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6638" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS12.png" alt="" width="800" height="465" /></p> 
<p>2. On the Forecast properties pane at the left, you can customize forecast settings. For example, you can change the number of periods to forecast into the future or add “forecast” periods into the past to compare historical actuals against ML-based expectations.</p> 
<p>You can adjust the width of the prediction band by changing the prediction internal and manually setting the seasonality (number of periods). Choose <strong>Apply</strong> to save your changes.</p> 
<p>3. Select a forecasted data point on the chart and choose <strong>What-if analysis</strong>. With What-if analysis, you can set target value for a particular date or date range, and Amazon QuickSight will adjust the forecast gracefully to meet the target.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6639" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS13.png" alt="" width="400" height="576" /></p> 
<p>4. Choose <strong>Apply</strong> to see the new forecast adjusted for the target along with the original forecast. You can hover over the data points to see details.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6640" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS14.png" alt="" width="800" height="471" /></p> 
<p>With ML-powered forecasting, Amazon QuickSight allows you to forecast complex, real-world scenarios such as data with multiple seasonality. Outliers will be excluded automatically, and missing values will be imputed.</p> 
<p>To export the forecasting data in CSV format, choose the selector in the upper right corner of the visual, and then choose <strong>Export to CSV</strong>.</p> 
<h2>Auto-narratives</h2> 
<p>Auto narratives allow you to create natural language summaries of your visuals. You can embed these summaries into your dashboard to highlight key insights that are important for your readers, allowing them to access the data without having to sift through the entire dashboard. When you define a template, narratives update automatically as the data in your data set refreshes, just like a visual. The following steps show you how to get started with auto narratives.</p> 
<p>1. In your time series chart, choose <strong>Insights</strong> again to show the suggested insights.</p> 
<p>2. An easy way to add a narrative insight to your analysis is to choose the plus sign (+) next to a suggested insight. For the purpose of this walkthrough, choose the Day Over Day Change insight.</p> 
<p>You’ll see an insight visual on your analysis with the predefined template. Notice that the field wells have the date, metric, and category filled in. These settings are populated from the visual that you used to create the insight visual. You can customize the fields as needed.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6641" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS15.png" alt="" width="316" height="148" /></p> 
<p>3. To edit the narrative, choose the insight visual menu and select <strong>Customize Narrative</strong>. You’ll see the Configure narrative pane where you can edit your insights template.. You can format the content with different sizes and colors using the formatting toolbar. You can also insert expressions and conditional statements like IF and FOR statements.</p> 
<p>In the left pane, you can add computations to your narrative. Computations are predefined calculations such as period-over-period, period-to-date, growth-rate, max, min, and top movers, that you can reference in your template to describe your data. Currently, Amazon QuickSight supports 13 different types of computations. In this example, PeriodOverPeriod is added by default since we selected the Day Over Day Change insight from the suggested insights pane.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6642" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS16.png" alt="" width="800" height="498" /></p> 
<p>4. To add a new computation, choose Add computation in the bottom left corner of the pane. You’ll be prompted to select from a list of computations. For the purpose of this walkthrough, select the <strong>Growth rate</strong> computation type, and select <strong>Next</strong>.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6643" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS17.png" alt="" width="800" height="443" /></p> 
<p>5. You can configure certain aspects of the computation. In the case of growth rate, you can change the number of periods over which that you want to compute growth. After you make your selections, choose <strong>OK</strong>.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6644" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS18.png" alt="" width="400" height="394" /></p> 
<p>6. Now expand Computations on the left pane. You should see both PeriodOverPeriod and GrowthRate options.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6645" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS19.png" alt="" width="800" height="502" /></p> 
<p>Please note that computation names must be unique. When you create a computation, assign a unique name. You can reference multiple computations of the same type in your template. For example, if you have two metrics, such as $sales and units sold, you can create a GrowthRate computation for each of the metrics, with a different name for each computation. The specific computations can then be referenced by name in the template.</p> 
<p>Also be aware that anomaly computation is not compatible with all other computation types. For example, if you have a PeriodOverPeriod or GrowthRate computation, you will not be able to add an Anomaly computation to the same insight visual.</p> 
<p>7. To add growth rate to your narrative, enter the phrase <strong>Compounded Growth Rate for the last</strong> on the narrative template. From the Computations pane, choose <strong>GrowthRate</strong>, and then choose <strong>timePeriods</strong> to insert the expression <strong>GrowthRate.timePeriods</strong> into your narrative. This expression references the number of periods set in the configuration.</p> 
<p>8. Complete the sentence by entering <strong>days is</strong>. Then add another expression from the Computations pane by choosing <strong>GrowthRate</strong>, then <strong>compounded GrowthRate</strong>, and then <strong>formattedValue</strong>. The selection <strong>formattedValue</strong> returns a phrase formatted according to the format applied to the metric on the field. To see a raw value in integer or decimal format, choose <strong>value</strong> instead of <strong>formattedValue</strong>.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6646" style="margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;border: 1px solid #cccccc" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2019/03/14/MLInsightsQS20.png" alt="" width="800" height="503" /></p> 
<p>Now, let’s try using a conditional statement.</p> 
<p>1. To insert an IF statement, place the cursor at the end of your narrative template. From the <strong>Insert Code</strong> menu, choose <strong>Inline IF</strong>.</p>
