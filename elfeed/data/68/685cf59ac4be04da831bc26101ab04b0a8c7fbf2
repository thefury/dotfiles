<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So this might be kind of stupid, but y’all all know the struggle. Forgetting to clean your room or just straight up evading it because the idea of starting to clean it is literally physically impossible, and the duration that would take of intense concentration is exhausting even to think about. </p> <p>However, there’s something that I do sometimes that really helps out. </p> <p>I take a time lapse video of me cleaning my room. </p> <p>1) it eliminates the ability of taking my phone out cause it’s recording 2) I know I’m being recorded so there’s a lil added pressure to keep going 3) the end result is super cool to watch </p> <p>After seeing a 30 second time lapse of me cleaning my room up a fair amount (had to stop cause the doorbell rang) it made me mentally rewire the experience into only 30 seconds. </p> <p>I don’t know if this would work for other people but it really helped me so I figured I’d share!!</p> <p>Edit: Wow!!! Thank you so much for silver!! I just want to help everyone out cause we all know that struggle!! ♥️</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bluebaripie"> /u/bluebaripie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwd76y/life_hack_for_overwhelming_tasks_like_room/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwd76y/life_hack_for_overwhelming_tasks_like_room/">[comments]</a></span>
