<p>We are pleased to announce the availability of the second beta release of HashiCorp Terraform 0.12! The 0.12 release of Terraform contains major language improvements and a host of new features. You can learn more about the new functionality in our <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-0-1-2-preview">0.12 preview blog series</a>, or by browsing the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/">configuration language docs</a> which are updated to reflect 0.12 improvements.</p>

<h2>Supported Providers</h2>

<p>For the Beta 2 release we have been focused on getting our providers fully 0.12 compatible and automatically downloadable via <code>terraform init</code>. As of the initial Beta 2 release, many providers are released with 0.12 support, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/archive/index.html">archive</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html">aws</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/tls/index.html">tls</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The list of providers available in <code>terraform init</code> will continue to grow as we work to cut 0.12-ready releases for all providers.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-terraform-0-1-2-beta1">Beta 1</a>, providers not available in <code>terraform init</code> can be tested by installing <a href="http://terraform-0.12.0-dev-snapshots.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/">development snapshots</a> as <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins%5D">third-party plugins</a>.</p>

<p>Note that some resources in the newly released providers will produce <code>Incorrect attribute value type</code> errors with older Alpha and Beta releases of Terraform 0.12.  Be sure you upgrade to Beta 2 as you test the new providers.</p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p>To try out the Beta 2 release, you can <a href="https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.0-beta2/">download the release tagged terraform_0.12.0-beta2</a>. From there you can review the HCL language changes and write a new configuration, or take an existing configuration and try the <code>terraform 0.12upgrade</code> command. Then dive into a plan and see what the diff looks like.</p>

<p>As with all pre-release builds, remember that v0.12.0-beta2 may still contain bugs and we do not recommend using it in a production setting. We welcome your feedback on the beta If you run into an issue, please file a new Bug Report in GitHub. Please check the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av0.12.0">0.12 milestone</a> before filing to see if your issue has already been reported.</p>
