<p> The AWS SDKs and Tools team invites you to the first-ever online office hour hosted by the maintainers of the AWS SDK for Ruby. It will be held via Google Hangouts at&nbsp;<b>11:00am-12:00pm PDT (UTC -7:00) on Tuesday 6/30</b>. If you don’t have one already, you will need to create an account with Google to join the video chat.</p> 
<p> This first office hour will be driven by customer questions. We expect to focus on questions about the SDK, but any questions related to Ruby development on AWS are welcome. We’re excited to meet you and help you be successful in developing Ruby applications on AWS!</p>
