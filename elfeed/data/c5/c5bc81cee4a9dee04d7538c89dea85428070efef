<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yesterday i had been reading &quot;Taking charge of adult ADHD&quot; and Barkley talked about &quot;externalizing time&quot;. My showers usually last for 30-45 minutes because i keep spacing out and daydreaming. It is a massive waste of water and i feel bad about it, but no good intention has helped me conquer it so far until today.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I downloaded an interval timer and set it up to beep every minute for 5 minutes. As usual i played my music and every minute i would hear a clear beep reminding me to stay on task. While i spaced out for short duration&#39;s, the beep kept bringing me back where i could continue cleaning myself up. I showered calmly for 5 minutes. No rushing that made me start sweating after the shower, no frustration from wasting time and water, just a nice and calm shower.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Then i went on and did the same thing for getting dressed. What used to take an hour now took ten fucking minutes. I don&#39;t yet have access to medication, and this is my first conscious step to deal with my ADD. I&#39;m so fucking happy</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PastaNotFound"> /u/PastaNotFound </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bw8u65/i_showered_and_dressed_within_10_minutes_it_used/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bw8u65/i_showered_and_dressed_within_10_minutes_it_used/">[comments]</a></span>
