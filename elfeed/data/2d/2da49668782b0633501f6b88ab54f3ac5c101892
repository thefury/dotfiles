<p> Recently, Trevor, Loren, and myself from the AWS SDK team attended RailsConf in Atlanta. We had a great time at the conference and enjoyed connecting with many of you there.</p> 
<h2> Our Rails on Amazon Web Services Workshop</h2> 
<p> At RailsConf, we ran a workshop called <em>Deploy and Manage Ruby on Rails Apps on AWS</em>. It was an amazing experience for us, with attendees of all experience levels gettings hands-on experience not only deploying to AWS, but learning about the tools we’ve made to help make integrations easier.</p> 
<p> For those of you who could not make it, you can still give this workshop a try!</p> 
<ul> 
 <li> Detailed step-by-step instructions, the same as we provided to attendees, are <a href="http://railsconf2015-aws.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/">available here</a>.</li> 
 <li> You can also follow along with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQoYTeGJYf4">presentation recording</a> on YouTube.</li> 
 <li> Code for the sample app is available on <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/todo-app-railsconf">GitHub</a>.</li> 
 <li> If you’d like to try using Amazon Relational Database Service instead of using AWS OpsWorks managed MySQL, you can reference our <a href="http://ruby.awsblog.com/post/Tx30I1YMLBH2TU8/Using-Amazon-RDS-with-Ruby-on-Rails-and-AWS-OpsWorks">blog post</a> on that topic as well.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2> Continuing the Conversation</h2> 
<p> We hope to see more of you on the conference trail again soon! Apropos of this, it is worth mentioning that <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent</a> registration is open at the time of writing. We will be there, and we hope to see you there!</p>
