With the sharp increase in demand for social media insights from our <a href="http://pages.crimsonhexagon.com/AWSPartnerships_ForsightProductDemonstration.html?utm_source=AWS&amp;utm_medium=USPartnerReferral&amp;utm_campaign=AWS%20Partnership">ForSight platform</a> came spikes in analysis load. At times we were vulnerable to congestion, so analysis run times became unpredictable. We needed to be able to scale our data and analysis resources to meet this demand. Our goal was to enable any monitor to run insights in an hour or less, no matter the concurrent load of historical data.</p><p><strong>Why Crimson Hexagon chose the AWS platform</strong></p><p>When considering new service offerings, AWS was the clear choice. The initial migration to AWS allowed us to quickly scale our offering and reduce run times by 82%. Using their extensive API, we accommodated our customer needs by dynamically provisioning computing capacity in response to spikes in <a href="http://pages.crimsonhexagon.com/AWSPartnerships_ForsightProductDemonstration.html?utm_source=AWS&amp;utm_medium=USPartnerReferral&amp;utm_campaign=AWS%20Partnership">ForSight</a> analysis demand. We also implemented Amazon SQS to decouple our data, alongside our own internal task queue to accommodate all of our in-depth services.</p><p><strong>More data, faster speeds</strong></p><p>Thanks to AWS, Crimson Hexagon has been able to easily scale our infrastructure while the size of our social index has more than doubled over the last few years. We can offer our clients access to as much data as they like without limitations on keywords or volume, unlike our competition. Moreover, in recent testing, our median report run time has now been reduced by 97% since initial implementation.</p><p><strong>Contact us</strong></p><p>Crimson Hexagon’s platform delivers on-demand social insights for the enterprise.
