<p><b>CVE Identifier: CVE-2019-5736</b></p> 
<p>AWS is aware of the recently disclosed security issue which affects several open-source container management systems (CVE-2019-5736). With the exception of the AWS services listed below, no customer action is required to address this issue.</p> 
<p><b>Amazon Linux</b></p> 
<p>An updated version of Docker (docker-18.06.1ce-7.amzn2) is available for Amazon Linux 2 extras repositories and Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03 repositories (<a href="https://alas.aws.amazon.com/ALAS-2019-1156.html" target="_blank">ALAS-2019-1156</a>). AWS recommends that customers using Docker in Amazon Linux launch new instances from the latest AMI version. Further information is available in the <a href="https://alas.aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Linux Security Center</a>.<br /> </p> 
<p><b>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)</b></p> 
<p>Amazon ECS Optimized AMIs, including the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html" target="_blank">Amazon Linux AMI</a>, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/al2ami.html" target="_blank">Amazon Linux 2 AMI</a>, and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/gpuami.html" target="_blank">GPU-Optimized AMI</a>, are available now. As a general security best practice, we recommend that ECS customers update their configurations to launch new container instances from the latest AMI version. Customers should replace existing container instances with the new AMI version to address the issue described above. Instructions to replace existing container instances can be found in the ECS documentation for the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI_launch_latest.html" target="_blank">Amazon Linux AMI</a>, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/al2ami-get-latest.html" target="_blank">Amazon Linux 2 AMI</a>, and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/gpuami-get-latest.html" target="_blank">GPU-Optimized AMI</a>.</p> 
<p>Linux customers who do not use the ECS Optimized AMI are advised to consult with the vendor of your operating system, software, or AMI for updates and instructions as needed. Instructions about Amazon Linux are available in the <a href="https://alas.aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Linux Security Center</a>.<br /> </p> 
<p><b>Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS)</b></p> 
<p>An updated <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html" target="_blank">Amazon EKS Optimized AMI</a> is available in the AWS Marketplace.

<p>Customers running Fargate Services should call UpdateService with &quot;--force-new-deployment&quot; enabled to launch all new Tasks on the latest Platform Version 1.3. Customers running standalone tasks should terminate existing tasks, and re-launch using the latest version. Specific instructions can be found in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/update-service.html" target="_blank">Fargate update documentation</a>.</p>

<p><b>AWS SageMaker</b></p> 
<p>An updated version of Amazon SageMaker is available. Customers using Amazon SageMaker's default algorithm containers or framework containers for training, tuning, batch transform, or endpoints are not affected.

All endpoints, labeling, training, tuning, compilation, and batch transform jobs launched on February 11th or later include the latest update with no customer action required. All Amazon SageMaker notebooks launched on February 11th or later with CPU instances and all Amazon SageMaker notebooks launched on February 13th 18:00 PT or later with GPU instances include the latest updates with no customer action required.<br /> <br /> AWS recommends that customers running training, tuning, and batch transform jobs with custom code created before February 11th stop and start their jobs to include the latest update. These actions can be done from the Amazon SageMaker console or by following the instructions <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_Operations.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /> <br /> Amazon SageMaker automatically updates all endpoints that are in-service to the latest software every four weeks.

If there are any issues with the automatic updates and customers are required to take action to update their endpoints, Amazon SageMaker will publish a notification in the customersâ€™ Personal Health Dashboard. Customers who wish to update their endpoints sooner can manually update their endpoints from the Amazon SageMaker console or by using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_UpdateEndpoint.html" target="_blank">UpdateEndpoint</a> API action at any time. We recommend that customers who have endpoints with autoscaling enabled take the additional precaution of following the instructions <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/endpoint-scaling-update.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 
<p>AWS recommends that customers running Docker containers in Amazon SageMaker notebooks stop and start their Amazon SageMaker notebook instances to get the latest available software. This can be done from the Amazon SageMaker console. Alternately, customers can first stop the notebook instance using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_StopNotebookInstance.html" target="_blank">StopNotebookInstance</a> API and then start the notebook instance using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/API_StartNotebookInstance.html" target="_blank">StartNotebookInstance</a> API.<br /> </p>
