<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>Terribly sorry for the long rant:</strong></p> <p>(I was evaluated at age 35 with mild ADD)</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>8 months ago I joined an awesome working place (good ppl, open minded and tolerant), and at the same time one of the team members went on maternity leave.I worked with the team ~4-5 months until she returned, and after a month or so she was promoted as a team leader.</p> <p>I’ve already had unpleasant vibes from her as a team member, so when she was promoted, I got worried.</p> <p>I’ve noticed, after a month, she is not pleased with me. She didn’t like I’m asking “common sense” questions (common sense to her, not to me). I won’t go into details about her attitude and how I lost my confidence and got stressed every time she was around.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Eventually I got really frustrated from her “I’m not pleased” reaction to one of my “stupid” questions, and admitted I see and think a bit differently from her due to the ADD. And gave her a short explanation about ADD (she knew ADHD from a relative, but I felt she didn’t really buy the one with the missing “H”)</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>She replied “thanks” and that “she will have a chat with the boss to see how they can manage me better” (I’ve never asked them to treat me in any special way. On the contrary, I told them “give me everything you got, I like challenges”. I just wanted them to understand the way I see things and stop getting angry with me).</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I’m good at “reading” ppl – her body language didn’t reflect any acceptance nor tolerance and I knew I made a huge mistake.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>After 3-4 weeks I was informed I’m fired and not to come to work the day after.</p> <p>Reason: “You are redundant because the biggest project was cancelled” (We all knew about that project from day 1, but also knew there are “other new projects” instead).</p> <p>I later asked an informant what they told about my redundancy and confirmed they are planning to expand the team (hire more ppl?)</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>First time in my whole life that I’m being fired when my working attributes couldn’t compensate for which ever bugged them (I’m very dedicated, responsible, hard worker, team player, friendly, care about the team and what we do).</p> <p>Up until now, I didn’t feel any need to share management about my ADD. No one had issues with me what’s so ever (and they were matured and patient enough to deal with my “annoying questions”)</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><strong>Damn!</strong></p> <p>I just lost an awesome job! (and it took me so long to find it)</p> <p>How could I be so naïve and stupid?!</p> <p>It won’t be easy to find another job because, now, I have TWO jobs in a row with less than a year when the later fired me – and no one is stupid enough to believe the “redundancy” lame excuse.</p> <p>(FYI: In the prev job, the management bullied all the team, so everyone have left)</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><strong>Lesson learned:</strong></p> <p>NEVER EVER tell ppl about your ADHD/ADD, no matter how open minded and tolerant they look like, unless they, themselves, have it.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><strong>*sob sob\</strong>*</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/poniesandsparkles"> /u/poniesandsparkles </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwneke/i_think_i_just_caused_myself_to_be_fired_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwneke/i_think_i_just_caused_myself_to_be_fired_from/">[comments]</a></span>
