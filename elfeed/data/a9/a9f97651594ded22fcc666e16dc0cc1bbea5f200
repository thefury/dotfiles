Ben Sigelman is the CEO and Cofounder LightStep. LightStep is rethinking observability in the emerging world of microservices. He spent nine years at Google where he led the design and development of several global-scale monitoring systems. The most significant of these were Dapper, an always-on distributed tracing system, and Monarch, a high-availability time series collection, storage, and query system. 

Join us as we chat about monitoring approaches in the world of distributed systems, OpenTracing, and the growing world of observability with awesome projects like Zipkin.
