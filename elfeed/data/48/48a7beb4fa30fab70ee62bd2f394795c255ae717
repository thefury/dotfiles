<p pid="25">The author of a bug bounty write-up published in Medium on March 20, username 'terjanq', demonstrated that the response to a resource varies based on the state of authorization of the user requesting it. As we explained in a previous blog post, referenced below, if the user is authorized to view the resource, the <code>Content-Type</code> header has the value 'text/html'. However, if the opposite is the case, the response returns without a <code>Content-Type</code> header, which is equal to the value 'text/plain'.</p>
<p pid="27">In this blog post, we analyze the role of the <code>Content-Type</code> header and HTTP status codes in obtaining user data using terjanq's research. We also suggest methods that can be used to prevent the scenario described in his writeup.</p>
