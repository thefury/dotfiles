<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I found that I can either feel good in a very quiet environment that is super low on sensory input, OR in a very loud and busy environment but the medium is hard.</p> <p>So basically I feel at peace and happy when I&#39;m out in nature at the asscrack of civilisation with nothing but trees and rocks around me, and I also feel happy when I&#39;m in a club with super loud music and can dance and party for hours.</p> <p>It&#39;s the middle ground that I can&#39;t stand and that makes me antsy and restless. Hence I constantly feel torn between extremes, I either want to live in the middle of nowhere or in a huge metropolis (which is currently the case), I either want to work from home with noone there OR in a super fun busy job, etc and it&#39;s often very hard to find a compromise.</p> <p>Anyone else?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MorthaP"> /u/MorthaP </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwpoh2/i_feel_like_i_need_either_super_high_or_super_low/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwpoh2/i_feel_like_i_need_either_super_high_or_super_low/">[comments]</a></span>
