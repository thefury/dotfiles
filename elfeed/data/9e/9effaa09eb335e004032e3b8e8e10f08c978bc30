<p><a href="http://www.cancer.gov/" target="_blank">The National Cancer Institute</a> (NCI) is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US government’s principal agency for cancer research and training. NCI coordinates the National Cancer Program, supporting research, training, health information dissemination, and programs that research the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cancer, rehabilitation from cancer, and the care of cancer patients and their families.</p> 
<p>NCI faced several data backup challenges. For a research organization with 9,000 staff, securing and backing up data contained on endpoints—desktops and laptops—were essential. The large staff traveled frequently, often working in multiple locations, and data loss was a significant issue. That loss occurred through a combination of failing machines; lost, stolen, or dropped devices; and user failure to back up data.</p> 
<p>Using Druva inSync, NCI has transformed its approach to data loss and recovery by drastically reduced user data loss, automated backup and recovery managed mostly by end users, speedier response to FOIA and forensics requests, freed up IT team to focus on mission-critical tasks, and enabled digital transformation</p>
