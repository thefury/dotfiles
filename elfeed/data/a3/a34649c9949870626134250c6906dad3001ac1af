<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Eight months ago, I quit my job at a really terrible sales group for a tech company. At the time I had recently graduated and they promised me that I would learn some valuable experience as a paid intern, but it was an absolute hellhole. My anxiety was through the roof at having to call tech companies, and trying to sell shitty products to state departments, when I barely struggled to be able to call in to order a pizza. My boss had told me I would never get anywhere without sales, right after I had put in my two week notice. </p> <p>This depressed me, and for a few months through the holidays, I felt worthless. With the urgency of my dad, I took up volunteering as an unpaid intern at my college for their IT department, and I loved every second it, but the problem with ADHD, is that after a day of doing something in the field you work in, once you break from that, you have no interest in putting anything more towards that, and it made it very hard for me to want to search for places I could apply to. What made it hard too was that i was also studying for a CompTIA Security+ certification, and I failed the test by 100 points (you need 700/900 to pass, and I got 598). </p> <p>Something they don&#39;t tell you about the IT field, is that it&#39;s a mostly male dominated group, and while that&#39;s not necessarily a problem, I live in Alabama, so for me, a female, I felt like I wasn&#39;t getting anywhere. I thought that I wasn&#39;t good enough. Every resume I would send in, I would either never get a reply, or I would get one that said I wasn&#39;t what they were looking for. </p> <p>What motivated me though, was an IT tech who also has ADHD, who was telling me about how impressed he was at my skill, and that I should have no problem getting a job, and that I&#39;m really skilled, and might even be better than him. So I kept trying, I looked really hard at my resume and tried to take out anything that might have been a red flag to a bot, and I finally got an email this morning saying they want to do a phone interview to know a little more about me. </p> <p>A phone interview is by no means a promise of anything, but it tells me that I&#39;m one step better than I was before, and that I must be doing something right. It gives me at least a glimmer of hope to ask someone on what I can improve. </p> <p>I don&#39;t think I would&#39;ve had the motivation to keep applying for jobs and to keep trying if it weren&#39;t for someone else who had ADHD who took the time to tell me that I had the skill, and that I had nothing to worry about, and the next time I meet someone else who has it, I&#39;m going to tell them the very same thing. </p> <p>Brent, if you&#39;re subbed to this thread and are reading this, thank you, and I&#39;m sorry for the shitty Pokemon Go gifts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lettadaloki"> /u/lettadaloki </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwribd/i_finally_got_a_phone_interview_after_6_months_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwribd/i_finally_got_a_phone_interview_after_6_months_of/">[comments]</a></span>
