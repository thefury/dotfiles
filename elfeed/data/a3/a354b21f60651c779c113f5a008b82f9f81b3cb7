<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Dear <a href="/r/ADHD">/r/ADHD</a> community,</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I am currently writing my Masterâ€™s thesis at Erasmus University Rotterdam. As someone who has ADHD herself, I decided to conduct my research on decision under uncertainty for individuals who are diagnosed with ADHD and for this, I need your help! I would be very thankful if you could fill out a short survey that takes 3 to 5 minutes. Your input is greatly appreciated.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Your participation and the results will remain completely anonymous, you will not be asked to reveal any identifying information about yourself. The research has been approved by the university&#39;s ethics board, and all data will only be used for academic purposes. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>If you have specific questions before starting the survey, please let me know in the comment section. I will try to answer as fast as possible. </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>You can find the survey by clicking on the following link: <a href="https://erasmusuniversity.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7O4dEfqPkK2niKN">Erasmus University Survey - r/ADHD</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>One last favor: Please try to not give away too detailed information about the questions in the comment section, as that helps to allow everyone to participate with the same initial information. After the data has been collected, I will create a new post with more information about the background and results if there is any interest.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BigSmallDimma"> /u/BigSmallDimma </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwqtfx/want_to_turn_your_procrastination_into_useful/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwqtfx/want_to_turn_your_procrastination_into_useful/">[comments]</a></span>
