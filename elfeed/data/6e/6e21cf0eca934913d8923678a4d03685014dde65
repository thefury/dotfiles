<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve started taking a booster dose of dexedrine IR in the evenings after getting home from work. Today, I laid down for 45 mins, dragged myself up to take my medicine, then went back to bed. Later, I found myself getting out of bed to get up to eat. And then I kind of stopped in shock at myself. Looked at my watch and lo and behold it was 30 mins after I took my medicine, correlating with when it should have kicked in.</p> <p>I am someone who loves food, is always hungry, and enjoys cooking yet it is still an absolute chore to cook or even get up to microwave pre-prepared food. I used to lay down for 2-3 hrs trying to talk myself into getting up to make food. By the time I finally did it, it would be 9 pm. Hence I would eat dinner late and go to bed late. Who knew that stimulant medication would finally allow me to actually eat and go to bed at a proper time?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thesilversound"> /u/thesilversound </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwif33/meds_help_me_get_up_and_walk_ten_steps_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwif33/meds_help_me_get_up_and_walk_ten_steps_to/">[comments]</a></span>
