<p>AWS is launching its first conference dedicated to cloud security, <a href="https://reinforce.awsevents.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AWS re:Inforce</a>, which will take place June 25-26, 2019 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.</p> 
<p>At AWS, we encourage everyone to be a builder, to learn and be curious, and to use AWS products and services to explore the Art of the Possible. At re:Inforce, you’ll have an opportunity to see our “culture of building” at the AWS re:Inforce Builders Fair. The Builders Fair is a set of “science fair” projects from AWS employees that highlight different aspects of security built upon the AWS cloud. You’ll see how AWS services can be used to solve real-world security problems and you’ll get ideas that you can use in your own organization.</p> 
<p>The Builders Fair features eight teams of AWS employees from Brazil, Chile, China, and the United States who were chosen out of nearly 100 submissions to our call for presenters. Every project was reviewed by a team of five judges and evaluated against a number of criteria, including the subject and the services used. We looked for submissions that were relevant to both the current and the future state of cloud security. The selected projects cover a number of areas, including data anonymization, chaos testing, detecting social engineering, voice services, and application protection. We’re really excited to share them with you.</p>

Please stop by the Builders Fair, meet our team members, and consider the Art of the Possible when it comes to security backed by the power of the AWS cloud.</p>
