<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure how to start this, because I have so many feelings going at once. Mostly sadness, because of all the things I&#39;ve missed out on.</p> <p>In middle school I was tested for ADHD, and put on Strattera(Sp?). This made me incredibly depressed and I was taken off it fairly quickly, and told ADHD was a misdiagnosis, or the medicine would have worked. That was a lie. Instead of trying to find additional medication that worked, my mom just gave me a caffeine pill every morning as a way to get me to focus.</p> <p>I found all this out last week when I looked up ADHD symptoms and mentioned to my parents that I thought I had it. That&#39;s when I was told all of the above, and now everything makes sense. Why I get nothing done before my 3rd cup of coffee. Why in the evenings, when I can&#39;t drink caffeine, my willpower goes out the window. Why I barely made it through college. The only upside is that the military let me in, because I didn&#39;t know when I enlisted.</p> <p>It just feels like such a shock. What could I have accomplished if I had been put on proper medication? Could I have gotten scholarships? Would I actually have hobbies I&#39;m good at, instead of being mediocre at a lot of stuff? It feels like I&#39;ve had a 100lb weight tied around my waist for my entire adult life, and not understanding how everyone was so much faster. On top of that, I can&#39;t get in to see a psychiatrist until MAYBE the end of June, and even that isn&#39;t guaranteed. I guess I&#39;m just ranting now, but I feel like I finally understand why It seems so hard to do basic tasks, and how it felt like no one else struggled with it. If you&#39;ve read this far, thank you. I don&#39;t know what the point of this all is, but I feel better typing it out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OhNoItDaPoPo911"> /u/OhNoItDaPoPo911 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwqq4e/i_discovered_i_was_diagnosed_with_adhd_in_middle/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwqq4e/i_discovered_i_was_diagnosed_with_adhd_in_middle/">[comments]</a></span>
