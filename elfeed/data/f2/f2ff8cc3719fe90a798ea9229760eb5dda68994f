<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Shameless stealing that question from the Frontpage, because I realized that there is no album where I could do that. If I love an Album, I would be so excited about the upcoming tracks that I would want to skip to them quickly, and other around if its not exciting enough, I would just skip to the best parts...... I mean yeah sure, one song, probably 2.... if I try to concentrate but a complete album?........ total illusion</p> <p>What you say? :D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/raudssus"> /u/raudssus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwqio1/is_there_an_album_you_can_listen_to_all_the_way/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwqio1/is_there_an_album_you_can_listen_to_all_the_way/">[comments]</a></span>
