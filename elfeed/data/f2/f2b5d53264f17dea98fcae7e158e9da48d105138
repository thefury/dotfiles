    <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2016-results" target="_blank">2016</a>, thousands of you helped the


    project by lending your voice via the Go user survey. In October, hundreds of


    companies helped us understand how enterprises are using Go by taking the Go company


    questionnaire. These surveys and questionnaires have played an enormous role in


    driving changes to our language and community, from


    <a href="https://blog.golang.org/conduct-2018" target="_blank">our new code of conduct</a>, to our


    <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go1.11" target="_blank">latest release Go 1.11</a>.

    Today we are conducting the 2018 Go user survey. We’d like to hear from <b>all</b> Go


    users in order to help us to create the best programming language that fits the


    needs and desires of the people closest to it. Please help us shape the future of Go


    by participating in the 15-minute 2018 Go user survey by November 30th:

  <h4 id="TOC_2.">Spread the word!</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    We need as many Gophers as possible to participate in this survey to help us better


    understand our global user base. We’d be grateful if you would spread the word by


    sharing this post on your social network feeds, around the office, at meetups, and in


    other communities.
