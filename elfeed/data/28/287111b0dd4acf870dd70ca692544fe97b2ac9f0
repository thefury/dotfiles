<p>AWS is aware of two recently disclosed security issues in Kubernetes (CVE-2019-1002101 and CVE-2019-9946). With the exception of the AWS services listed below, no customer action is required to address these issues.</p> 
<p><b>Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS)</b></p> 
<p>Amazon EKS's managed Kubernetes control plane is not impacted by these security issues. An updated Amazon EKS-optimized AMI is now available. Customers should replace existing worker nodes with the new AMI version to address the issue described above. Instructions on how to update worker nodes can be found in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-workers.html" target="_blank">EKS documentation</a>. Additionally, customers should update their kubectl binary to the latest version.
