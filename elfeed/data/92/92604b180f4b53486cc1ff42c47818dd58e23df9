<p>The AWS Region in Hong Kong SAR is now open and you can start using it today. The official name is <span title="">Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)</span> and the API name is <strong>ap-east-1</strong>. The AWS <span title="">Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)</span> Region is the eighth active AWS Region in Asia Pacific and mainland China along with Beijing, Mumbai, Ningxia, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, and, Tokyo. With this launch, AWS now spans 64 Availability Zones within 21 geographic regions around the world. We have also announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Bahrain, Cape Town, Jakarta, and Milan.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Using the Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) Region</strong></span><br /> As we <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-permissions-to-enable-accounts-for-upcoming-aws-regions/">announced last month</a>, you need to explicitly enable this region for your AWS account in order to be able to create and manage resources within it. Enabling or disabling a region requires the <code>account:EnableRegion</code>, <code>account:DisableRegion</code>, and <code>account:ListRegions</code> permissions. Here’s a sample IAM policy that grants these permissions for the new region:</p> 
<div class="hide-language"> 
 <pre class="unlimited-height-code"><code class="lang-json">{
   &quot;Version&quot;:&quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
   &quot;Statement&quot;:[
      {
         &quot;Effect&quot;:&quot;Allow&quot;,
         &quot;Action&quot;:[
            &quot;aws-portal:ViewAccount&quot;,
            &quot;account:ListRegions&quot;
         ],
         &quot;Resource&quot;:&quot;*&quot;
      },
      {
         &quot;Effect&quot;:&quot;Allow&quot;,
         &quot;Action&quot;:[
            &quot;account:EnableRegion&quot;,
            &quot;account:DisableRegion&quot;
         ],
         &quot;Resource&quot;:&quot;*&quot;,
         &quot;Condition&quot;:{
            &quot;StringEquals&quot;:{
               &quot;account:TargetRegion&quot;:&quot;ap-east-1&quot;
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}</code></pre> 
</div> 
<p>Log in to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a> as a user that has these appropriate permissions and click <strong>My Account</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/hkg_acct_menu_1.png" width="500" height="449" /></p> 
<p>Scroll down to the <strong>AWS Regions</strong> section, find the new region, and click <strong>Enable</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/hkg_regions_enabler_1.png" width="800" height="585" /></p> 
<p>Then confirm your action by clicking <strong>Enable region</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/hkg_confirm_enable_1.png" width="650" height="565" /></p> 
<p>The region is enabled immediately, and will be ready for use shortly thereafter.</p> 
<p>You can also enable the region by selecting it from the menu:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/hkg_region_menu_1.png" width="400" height="608" /></p> 
<p>And then confirming your action:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/hkg_region_enable_from_menu_2.png" width="900" height="372" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Connectivity, Edge Locations, and Latency</strong></span><br /> Hong Kong SAR is already home to three <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" title="">Amazon CloudFront</a> edge locations (the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/distribute-your-content-with-amazon-cloudfront/">first one opened</a> way back in 2008). There are also more than thirty other edge locations and eleven regional edge caches in Asia; see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/">Amazon CloudFront Infrastructure</a> page for a full list.</p> 
<p>The region offers low-latency connections to other cities and AWS regions in the area. Here are the latest numbers:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2019/hkg_latency_1.png" width="706" height="471" /></p> 
<p>There are now two Hong Kong <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/" title="">AWS Direct Connect</a> locations: the existing one at <a href="https://www.iadvantage.net/index.php/locations/mega-i">iAdvantage Mega-I</a> and a new one at <a href="https://www.equinix.com/locations/asia-colocation/hong-kong-colocation/hong-kong-data-center/hk1/">Equinix HK1</a>. Both locations have direct connectivity to the <span title="">Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)</span> Region. If you already connect to AWS at iAdvantage, you can use your existing Direct Connect connection to access the new region via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-direct-connect-gateway-inter-region-vpc-access/">Direct Connect Gateway</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Investing in the Future</strong></span><br /> Before I wrap up I would like to tell you about some of work that we are doing to support startups and to educate developers:</p>
