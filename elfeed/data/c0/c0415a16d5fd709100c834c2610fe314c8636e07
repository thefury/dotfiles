<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys, I&#39;m currently working on a golang api using Now (zeit.co), but I&#39;m having some difficulties...</p> <p>I have a file named <strong>rand_dict.go</strong>, which contains a Handler function used by Now, and a function which generate a random password from a words file (30k). When I launch <code>now dev</code>, everything works fine for all the other endpoints but when I tried to reach /rand_dict, an error 502 shows up... I think it came from the fact that the file can&#39;t load my words file...</p> <p>I tried to use the <strong>config.includeFiles</strong> in now.json but I can&#39;t make it worked. Can someone know how to help me ? You can go check the <a href="https://www.github.com/komfy/api">github</a> (you need to check the dev branch not the master one)</p> <p>N.B: The rand_dict file actually is named randDict and it&#39;s located inside the lambdas folder. </p> <p>Thanks for the future help :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/KaplaProd"> /u/KaplaProd </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/bwel0x/help_for_api_using_now_zeitco/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/bwel0x/help_for_api_using_now_zeitco/">[comments]</a></span>
