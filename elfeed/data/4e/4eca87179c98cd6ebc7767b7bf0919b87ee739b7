<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This might sound unnecessary for many but maybe it is helpful for others.</p> <p>I&#39;m a female 30yo ADD and I have never in my whole life been able to be consistent with normal daily habits like skincare i. E. remembering to use moisturizing cream on my face/hands, remembering to take my vitamins, or remembering my Ritalin. You know, these kind of stuff... </p> <p>But I&#39;ve cracked the code and I want to share my learning.</p> <p>Now I always keep my vitamins, my Ritalin and the cream in my office and it is when I&#39;m at the office that I most likely remember to do these stuff. I also keep some makeup, a toothbrush, and a nailscutter just in case. </p> <p>When I wake up it is too early to barely function so thanks god I put on underwear. But as I sit in the office these kind of stuff start hitting my brain.</p> <p>So tell me. Which are your tricks?!? I hope this helps you!!</p> <p>Edit: you forget to eat your fruit? Have a bowl with fruit at the office. It will stop you from eating junk food and you will get your fruit dose!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AEblirbedre"> /u/AEblirbedre </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwma8u/adhd_daily_habits_ive_cracked_the_code/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwma8u/adhd_daily_habits_ive_cracked_the_code/">[comments]</a></span>
