<p>You can now use telephony metadata from phone calls to obtain additional information about the source of the caller. Today, a caller can hide or mask the identity of their phone number by pressing special codes such *67 before dialing a contact center. Telephony metadata provides additional information from telephony carriers that help identify the source of the call.</p> 
<p>Previously the only telephony metadata available in Amazon Connect was the Caller-ID field displayed as the source number. Now, you can compare the Caller-ID information with additional telephony metadata to decide on how to route the caller. For example, if a caller is masking their phone number, they can be routed to a contact flow that provides greater security or an agent that specializes in authentication.</p>
