<p>AWS has published a whitepaper, <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/pci-dss-scoping-on-aws.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Architecting for PCI DSS Scoping and Segmentation on AWS</a>, to provide guidance on how to properly define the scope of your Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) workloads running on the AWS Cloud. The whitepaper looks at how to define segmentation boundaries between your in-scope and out-of-scope resources using cloud native AWS services. </p> 
<p>The whitepaper is intended for engineers and solution builders, but it also serves as a guide for Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs) and internal security assessors (ISAs) to better understand the different segmentation controls available within AWS products and services, along with associated scoping considerations.</p> 
<p>Compared to on-premises environments, software defined networking on AWS transforms the scoping process for applications by providing additional segmentation controls beyond network segmentation. Thoughtful design of your applications and selection of security-impacting services for implementing your required controls can reduce the number of systems and services in your cardholder data environment (CDE). </p> 
<p>The whitepaper is based on the PCI Council’s <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Guidance-PCI-DSS-Scoping-and-Segmentation_v1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Information Supplement: Guidance for PCI DSS Scoping and Network Segmentation</a>.</p>
