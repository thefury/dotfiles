<p>At AWS, our customersâ€™ security and privacy is of the highest importance and we continue to provide transparency into our security and privacy posture. Following our first SOC 2 Type 1 Privacy report released in December 2018, AWS is proud to announce the release of the Spring 2019 SOC 2 Type 1 Privacy report. The Spring 2019 SOC 2 Privacy report provides you with a third-party attestation of our systems and the suitability of the design of our privacy controls. The report also provides a detailed description of those controls, the same controls that AWS uses to address the GDPR requirements around data security and privacy.</p> 
<p>This updated report is a part of the SOC family of reports, and has been updated to align with the new Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA) Trust Service Criteria. The Trust Service Criteria align with the <a href="https://www.coso.org/Pages/ic.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 2013 framework</a> which has been designed to better address cybersecurity risks.</p> 
<p>The highlights of the new Trust Service Criteria include:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>A definition of principal service commitments and system requirements.</li> 
 <li>Restructuring and addition of supplemental criteria to better address cybersecurity risks.</li> 
 <li>New description criteria requiring the disclosure of system incidents.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The scope of the privacy report includes systems that AWS uses to collect personal information and all 104 services and locations in scope for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/spring-2019-soc-reports-now-available-with-104-services-in-scope/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest AWS SOC reports</a>.
