<p>Following the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1920/" target="_blank">recent announcement of updates to the PostgreSQL database</a>, we have updated Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility to support PostgreSQL minor version 10.7. This release fixes PostgreSQL security vulnerabilities included in the 10.7 minor release by the PostgreSQL community and contains <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.20180305.html" target="_blank">additional bug fixes and improvements</a>.</p> 
<p>To use the new version, you can create an Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility database instance with just a few clicks in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home" target="_blank">AWS Management Console</a>. You can also create an Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility 10.7 read replica using an RDS for PostgreSQL 10.7 master instance, and then fail over your connections and applications to Aurora when ready. Learn more about migrating to Aurora PostgreSQL 10.7 in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Migrating.RDSPostgreSQL.Replica.html" target="_blank">the Amazon RDS User Guide</a>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora" target="_blank">Amazon Aurora</a> combines the performance and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases. It provides up to three times better performance than the typical PostgreSQL database, together with increased scalability, durability, and security.</p>
