<p>Database Activity Streams for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/details/postgresql-details/">Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility</a> provides a near real-time data stream of the database activity in your relational database to help you monitor activity. When integrated with third party database activity monitoring tools, Database Activity Streams can monitor and audit database activity to provide safeguards for your database and help meet compliance and regulatory requirements.<br /> <br /> Solutions built on top of Database Activity Streams can protect your database from internal and external threats by monitoring access to your database. The collection, transmission, storage, and subsequent processing of the database activity is managed outside your database providing access control independent of your database users. Your database activity is pushed to an Amazon Kinesis data stream that is provisioned on behalf of your Aurora Cluster.<br /> <br /> Amazon RDS has partnered with IBM's Security Guardium and McAfee's Data Center Security Suite (both available in AWS Marketplace) for a seamless integration with the Kinesis stream provisioned for your Aurora Cluster. These partner applications can use the database activity stream information to generate alerts and provide auditing of all activity on your Amazon Aurora databases.<br /> <br /> You can learn more about using Database Activity Streams with Aurora PostgreSQL in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/DBActivityStreams.html">documentation</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/security">RDS Security</a> pages.</p>
