<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I started meds this week after only being diagnosed two weeks ago at the age of 23. In the last 2 days I have accomplished more than I have in the last 6 months. My glassed have been ordered, my office is clean, I have started back on my diet regime, my study is sorted, my laundry is done and I woke up at a normal time like a normal person instead of staying in bed until 12pm distracted by my phone. It just makes me wonder whether this is what normal people feel like? Have I been missing out on this for 23 years? I feel so fantastic and nobody around me gets it but I figured you guys would. Small victories everyone!!! Small victories. I am so proud of myself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shannen95"> /u/Shannen95 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwkx0n/is_this_what_neurotypical_people_feel_like/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwkx0n/is_this_what_neurotypical_people_feel_like/">[comments]</a></span>
