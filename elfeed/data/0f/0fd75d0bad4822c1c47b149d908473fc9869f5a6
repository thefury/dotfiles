<p>The cloud is now at the center of most Enterprise IT strategies. As such, a well-planned move to the cloud can result in immediate business payoff. To achieve such success, it’s important that you adopt Microsoft Active Directory (AD), the foundation of many large enterprise Windows and .NET applications in a secure, scalable, and highly available manner within the AWS Cloud.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/adds-on-aws.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignright wp-image-1065 size-full" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2019/03/11/ad_domain_services_cover_200x257.png" alt="" width="200" height="257" /></a>AWS offers flexible options for running AD, so as a customer it’s essential to select an architecture well-suited to support your applications. AWS offers a fully managed option called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/">AWS Managed Active Directory</a>, which enables your directory-aware workloads to use Managed Active Directory in AWS. You can also run Active Directory on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) and manage both the EC2 Instances and Active Directory, which provides the flexibility needed to extend an existing Active Directory domain to the AWS infrastructure.</p> 
<p>In this regard, we are very excited to release <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/adds-on-aws.pdf">Active Directory Domain Services for AWS Whitepaper</a>. This Active Directory whitepaper describes best practices for running Active Directory on AWS, including different architectural approaches for running AWS Managed AD and Active Directory on EC2 Instances. In addition, this document discusses the design considerations, security, network connectivity, and multi-region deployment of Active Directory for both scenarios.</p>
