<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im working on a project where i need to keep track of incoming jobs and their current status ( incoming jobs is coming through API&#39;s and are distributed to worker(s).</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>So along the lines of : jobRecieved, JobStarted, JobDone</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>My first implementation was using SQlite which most likely isnt the smartest way when it comes to speed, but it worked, but i would like to have something abit smoother, also i would love to have a noSQL abillity so i could store a larger jobStructure (a data segment for the job, not only the id and status ) which can vary in layout so i dont have to split it into fields in a table.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Params for me is :</p> <p>- fast both read - and write </p> <p>- embedded - dont want to call an external service </p> <p>- safe to call from different channels and go routines </p> <p>- if possible - allowed to be accessed by other processes ( this i can live without, just a nice to have )</p> <p>- possible to store any kind of structure on a key ( binary data ) </p> <p>- i would prefer not to go overkill ex some advanced database, as i really only would need quite simple lookups and updates, but there will be many read and writes going on </p> <p>- has to be insta-synced to disk so i can recover in case of crash</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Ive been reading through and looked around and there are many out there it seems, had almost pulled the trigger on BoltDB but then i was reading that it was great for reading but not for writing ( i doubt i will put as much pressure on this that i would be dealing with it, but from sake of learning i would like to go for the optimal for the job ).</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>BoltDB</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">https://github.com/boltdb/bolt</a> </p> <p>Bolthold:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/timshannon/bolthold">https://github.com/timshannon/bolthold</a> </p> <p>pogreb:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/akrylysov/pogreb">https://github.com/akrylysov/pogreb</a></p> <p>goqueue:</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/beeker1121/goque">github.com/beeker1121/goque</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Also Badger etc but thats abit on the same line as BoltDB.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>pogreb and goqueue are some small ones that kinda sounds like they will do the job, just dont know if they are viable in production.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Anyone have any suggestions ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/riverexit"> /u/riverexit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/bw89sz/fast_embedded_keyvalue_persistant_store_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/bw89sz/fast_embedded_keyvalue_persistant_store_for/">[comments]</a></span>
