<p pid="34">I was recently reading the book by the Indian philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti <em>On Education</em>, which talks about the need for schools to educate &quot;integrated&quot; beings, to make them conscious and reflective rather than &quot;dumbing them down&quot; with knowledge not to be discussed. </p> 
<p pid="34">Which then got me thinking about the subject of agility:&nbsp;<strong>Why aren't we teaching agility in grade school?</strong>&nbsp;Indeed, my research on the Net in terms of agility learning initiatives at school did not yield much at all.&nbsp;</p>
