<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you bike around Jane and Dundas West area, be careful. There are several incorrectly placed catch basins in a way that the slits align with the road and your wheels can get caught in it. It just happened with me on Dundas West while I was stopping at the Jane stop light. I was lucky that I was slowing down and didn&#39;t made me fall but it was a hell of a scare. After that one I noticed several of them are incorrectly placed, some of them by a bit and some by a lot. Be careful and bike safe!</p> <p>EDIT: misplaced is not the right word. They have been incorrectly placed in the way I mentioned above. Also, those are catch basins, not manhole covers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sadepicurus"> /u/sadepicurus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/bwoky5/attention_cyclists_from_etobicoke_and_west/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/bwoky5/attention_cyclists_from_etobicoke_and_west/">[comments]</a></span>
