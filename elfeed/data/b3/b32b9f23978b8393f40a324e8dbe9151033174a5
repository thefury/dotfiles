<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t think it would be over. It took me five years. I graduated with a 3.3 GPA.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I just remember finding out I have ADHD during the middle of my college journey. It was a big sigh of relief but upsetting that I didn&#39;t know sooner (especially since my brother was diagnosed at a young age - he is older than me).</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><strong>I just remember all those late nights struggling to focus</strong> - the verge of failing classes because of late assignments, submitting minutes before deadlines, begging professors to give me extra time, hyper-focusing on things that aren&#39;t even important during finals....</p> <p>....complaining about my part-time job - <em>then also complaining about being bored/depressed from not having a part-time job......</em></p> <p>having so much confidence in my work at one point, then switching to extreme insecurity the next (thanks mood swings!)</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I also remember my last post I made here, talking about how I bombed a presentation because I blanked during my speech, but I ended up receiving a B on the presentation - then an A leading my panel discussion. Overall in the class, I received an A-. My professor said I was an amazing speaker and have an &quot;enthralling&quot; voice! He even loved my writing, since it is so engaging.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><strong>I just remember all the friends I gained so quickly from talking so much</strong> - to losing them just as fast because I daydream too much and forgetting to text back all the time. (Then wondering why I don&#39;t have a lot of friends).</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I would say I am extremely happy (which I am), but I am also TIRED. I will pursue my Master&#39;s, but probably in the next 2-3 years ahaha.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Sorry if this post is boring, but I am so proud of myself....which is rare. I never thought I would graduate....and I&#39;m even getting job offers in positions I would like......I&#39;m so glad this feeling of college haunting me is over....I&#39;m free......lol....</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/misssarajones"> /u/misssarajones </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwioap/i_graduated_from_college_today/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwioap/i_graduated_from_college_today/">[comments]</a></span>
