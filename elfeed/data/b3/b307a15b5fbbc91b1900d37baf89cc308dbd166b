<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I&#39;ve put together a small CLI <a href="https://github.com/sematext/oxdpus">tool</a> that offers various options for attaching XDP programs to the network interfaces, managing the IP blacklist, and so on. In order to be able to distribute Go programs with the XDP bytecode baked inside the binaries, I had to fork gobpf to bring the support for XDP programs in ELF object files. There is also a PR in the upstream repo which I hope will be merged soon. If you want to learn more, here is the full blog post explaining what XDP is and how to exploit its features for fast packet processing in the kernel:</p> <p><a href="https://sematext.com/blog/ebpf-and-xdp-for-processing-packets-at-bare-metal-speed/">https://sematext.com/blog/ebpf-and-xdp-for-processing-packets-at-bare-metal-speed/</a></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Github repo: <a href="https://github.com/sematext/oxdpus">https://github.com/sematext/oxdpus</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rabbitstack"> /u/rabbitstack </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/bwoll6/packet_processing_with_ebpf_and_xdp/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/bwoll6/packet_processing_with_ebpf_and_xdp/">[comments]</a></span>
