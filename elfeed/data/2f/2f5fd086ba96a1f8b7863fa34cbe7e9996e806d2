<p> With the release of V2 of the AWS SDK for Ruby, we’ve received customer feedback asking for support for the Ruby on Rails integration features provided by V1 of the SDK.</p> 
<p> Today, we’re excited to announce the release of the aws-sdk-rails gem, available now via <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/aws-sdk-rails">RubyGems</a> and, of course, on <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-rails">GitHub</a>.</p> 
<p> To get started, add the <code>aws-sdk-rails</code> gem to your Gemfile:</p> 
<pre class="brush: ruby">
gem 'aws-sdk-rails', '~&gt; 1.0'
</pre> 
<h2> ActionMailer and Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)</h2> 
<p> The gem will automatically configure Rails to include an <code>:aws_sdk</code> delivery method for ActionMailer, that uses Amazon SES as a backend. It is simple to configure Rails to use this delivery method:</p> 
<pre class="brush: ruby">
# config/application.rb
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :aws_sdk
</pre> 
<p> The aws-sdk-rails gem will use the AWS SDK for Ruby V2’s SES client automatically for any mail delivery event.</p> 
<h2> Logging</h2> 
<p> The gem will automatically wire the AWS SDK for Ruby’s logger to use <code>Rails.logger</code> by default.</p> 
<p> You can customize the SDK log level and an optional log formatter in a config initializer:</p> 
<pre class="brush: ruby">
# config/initializers/aws-sdk.rb
# log level defaults to :info
Aws.config[:log_level] = :debug
</pre> 
<p> It is important to understand that <strong>all SDK log messages are logged at the same log level</strong>. Why is this important? When you set the Rails log level, you’re muting all log messages below that log level. So, if you want to, for example, only see SDK log messages in development, you might set the SDK log level to <code>:debug</code> as shown above, and set the Rails logger to show debug in development.</p> 
<h2> Credentials</h2> 
<p> The AWS SDK for Ruby will attempt locate credentials by searching the following locations:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li> <code>ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']</code> and <code>ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']</code></li> 
 <li> The shared credentials ini file at ~/.aws/credentials</li> 
 <li> From an instance profile when running on Amazon EC2</li> 
</ul> 
<p> If you need to manually configure credentials, you should add them to your initializer:</p> 
<pre class="brush: ruby">
# config/initializers/aws-sdk.rb
Aws.config[:credentials] = Aws::Credentials.new(access_key, secret)
</pre> 
<p> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/index.html#Credentials">Learn more about credentials in the AWS SDK for Ruby V2</a>.</p> 
<p> <strong>Never commit your credentials to source control.</strong> Besides being a security risk, it makes it very difficult to rotate your credentials.</p> 
<h2> Available Now</h2> 
<p> The <code>aws-sdk-rails</code> gem is available now.</p> 
<p> As always, we’d love to hear your feedback, and welcome any Issues or Pull Requests at the <a href="http://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-rails">aws-sdk-rails GitHub repo</a>.</p>
