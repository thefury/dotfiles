<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I just came back from Toronto with some friends and showed them the city (I come down at least twice per year) and somehow my last trip woke something in me. </p> <p>See I live in Quebec City and I&#39;m originally from eastern Europe (relevant to this post). I&#39;m a front-end developer and a social media marketing specialist. I&#39;ve been doing that for 10 years and have been a freelancer since I couldn&#39;t find a job in a company. When I was comleting my degree in college (4 years ago), my former marketing professor (who I had a great relationship with) brought me aside and told me that due to my name and origins I&#39;d have trouble landing a job in my field of work. </p> <p>I kinda brushed him off and thought he might be overreacting. Well, after a while of sending my CV and presentation letters to companies and not hearing anything back I tried to prove my former teacher wrong so I changed my name on my CV to a french-canadian sounding name and sent it to the same 5 companies I&#39;ve sent it to a while back (where none of them gave me news) and to my surprise 3 out of those 5 companies called me in for an interview. It got me really sad and angry that my name possibly caused my situation I&#39;m in so I didn&#39;t even accept to go to the interviews since I felt discriminated. </p> <p>Now I went to Toronto with some friends because I LOVE Toronto and wanted my friends to see the city (they also loved it) and I was so into showing my friends the city and how there were a lot of places you could eat at any time (back home after 10 you only have McDonalds and another restaurant that is open) where as in Toronto you have so many choices. Everyone was friendly and talkative and during the Raptors game 2 I was high-fiving everyone in the bar and people loved it and it ended up taking pictures with me. </p> <p>I love how I can speak in my language and nobody looks at me weird. I love it how everyone is accepting of everyone else. I love it how I see different nationalities everywhere I go. I love it how a lot of immigrants are given work and are happy to be in Toronto. I love how immigrants from different generations support the Raptors and support their Canadian values. I love how there&#39;s always something to do. I love how there&#39;s different nationalities in the police force. I love how the police actually talk to you nicely and ask you how your day has been. </p> <p>Back home, I don&#39;t love anything because there&#39;s nothing to love. I&#39;m &quot;depressed&quot; most of the time since I always end up being brought down by either some ignorant comments, discrimination or something else. I am sorry for this long ass post, but I wanted to include all of these details in my post. </p> <p>I have a goal to move to Toronto so I started looking for job postings in my field, but so far most of them are placement agencies looking for applicants so I was wondering and hoping some of you might point me towards the right direction and tell me where could I search for jobs in my field of work (web development). I went on Indeed and most of the jobs offered are posted by recruitment agencies and those who aren&#39;t, I&#39;ve saved them so that I can send them my resume. I haven&#39;t felt this type of passion in a long time. I&#39;m 29 years old and I feel as if approaching 30 makes me a &quot;loser&quot; and kind of worthless since everyone around me is pressuring me to get married and have kids. Personally, I don&#39;t feel and look like 29 so 30 is just a number for me, but subconsciously I&#39;m affected by the pressure. My old crew of friends are still going to the same nightclubs and still getting into the same trouble. I want change. I will stop writing to not bother you anymore with my story, but yeah, I&#39;m looking for directions. </p> <p>By the way, thanks for being an awesome city with awesome people. We&#39;ve had a blast!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/syphlect"> /u/syphlect </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/bwk8ks/i_want_to_move_to_toronto/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/bwk8ks/i_want_to_move_to_toronto/">[comments]</a></span>
