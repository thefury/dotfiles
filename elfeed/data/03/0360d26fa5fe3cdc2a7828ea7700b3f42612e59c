 <p><strong>May 22, 2019 update</strong>: We’ve removed a reference to the IT-Grundschutz Certification Workbook. AWS now recommends that customers refer to the Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalog (C5) instead. Learn more about C5 here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/bsi-c5/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/bsi-c5/</a></p>
</blockquote> 
<hr /> AWS has completed its 2018 assessment against the Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalog (C5) information security and compliance program. Germany’s national cybersecurity authority—Bundesamt f&uuml;r Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)—established C5 to define a reference standard for German cloud security requirements. With C5, customers in German member states can use the work performed under this BSI compliance catalog to comply with stringent local requirements.
