In this episode we talk to Mitchell Hashimoto, founder and co-CTO of HashiCorp and Paul Banks, software engineer on the Consul team.

We get a little insight into the personalities and backgrounds of both guests, most importantly we learn some amazing things about the new feature in Consul called Connect.  Why we need a Service Mesh and how it helps with security for dynamically scheduled and legacy applications.
