<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This year so far has been a roller coaster, but one that never really seems to allow gravity to bring the car back down. So far I’ve seen accomplishments such as being praised by not only my boss and peers, but my friends and family as well. My grades remained all A’s throughout the spring semester, even while working full time along my full time class schedule. My relationships have flourished in every nook and cranny in my life, and my dog is so tired from all of the nature hikes we’ve been going on, that she can’t even keep up with me. </p> <p>But the thing I am most proud of, is that I grew a garden. Even when I had never worked with wood ever before in my life, I managed to Jerry rig a bed together out of HT pallet wood. I did all of this by myself with very basic principles of how tools work, and have managed to keep everything together even through the mass of rain we’ve been getting. </p> <p>Because of my hard work and dedication, my food is flourishing, so much so that I won’t be able to eat it all myself when the time comes. Because I was anticipating that I would fail, I now have to build more beds because all of the seeds I have planted are doing so well that they are too close together (hey, even with all of the success I’ve been having, adhd still has to creep into my life somehow. Poor planning on my part). </p> <p>All of these accomplishments wouldn’t have happened even a year ago, if it weren’t for my doctor and the medicine that we have today. </p> <p>My life has changed so much in the past 8 months because of medication. It’s almost unbelievable that I am doing what I am, and succeeding in ways I never knew to be possible. Even if the saying didn’t come from where people thought we did, it still rings incredibly true; “if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid”.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Breh069"> /u/Breh069 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwrgls/i_did_it_i_grew_a_garden_with_my_own_two_hands/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwrgls/i_did_it_i_grew_a_garden_with_my_own_two_hands/">[comments]</a></span>
