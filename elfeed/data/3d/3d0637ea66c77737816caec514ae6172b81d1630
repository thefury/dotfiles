<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I had an appt at a clinic that I hadn&#39;t been to yet and was in a hurry to get to. Sometimes, by brother in law stores his car in our garage because me fiance and I park in the parking lot. When my brother in law takes his car out, my fiance has to move his car from beside mine to behind mine. I forgot about that this morning in my rush and ran into my fiance&#39;s car. I hate everything. I hate myself. I&#39;m such a forgetful fucking idiot that I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t killed anyone yet. Nothing like having a panic attack through tears on your way to your doctor&#39;s appt while trying to tell your SO how you fucked up their license plate.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/2_bewilder"> /u/2_bewilder </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwojs6/i_hate_everything_right_now/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwojs6/i_hate_everything_right_now/">[comments]</a></span>
