<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I take my meds, meditation is SO much easier and I feel like I get more out of it. It&#39;s also much more enjoyable. When I meditate normally, it&#39;s really difficult to harness my mind, and although it&#39;s certainly helpful it&#39;s way more of a challenge. Anyone else experience this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/scrabbleGOD"> /u/scrabbleGOD </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwr3rz/meditation_is_so_much_easier_on_meds/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwr3rz/meditation_is_so_much_easier_on_meds/">[comments]</a></span>
