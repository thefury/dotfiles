<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Lately, I&#39;ve been using a personal &#39;mantra&#39; of sorts in order to keep me focused and stop me from getting overwhelmed. It&#39;s actually working wonders and I&#39;m accomplishing far more than I&#39;ve ever done before, and I feel great while doing it.</p> <p>It&#39;s called &quot;Stop. And reduce.&quot;</p> <p>I know that you&#39;ve been in this situation. You have a task to do that you&#39;ve been putting off, and it&#39;s grown into this horrible insurmountable task, be it in reality or your own mind. You don&#39;t even know where to begin anymore, or if you do begin, you keep dancing around putting out fires and you&#39;re not really accomplishing anything.</p> <p>When you find yourself in that feeling, just repeat these words to yourself;</p> <p><strong>Stop. And reduce.</strong></p> <p>The beauty of this method is in the &#39;stop&#39; part. Actually physically <em>stop</em> what you&#39;re doing. This is crucial because it interrupts the thought patterns that are causing you stress. I suggest you integrate a physical response to the word &#39;stop&#39;. Take a seat, or take some breaths, maybe even walk into another room.</p> <p>Now that you&#39;ve &#39;stopped&#39;. Think about the task at hand, and then <strong>reduce</strong> it to the bare minimum task.</p> <p>You need to tidy your room, which you haven&#39;t touched in weeks. Every attempt to start ends in frustration, as you can&#39;t decide whether to clear the desk or change the sheets. So you need to <strong>reduce</strong> the task, because &#39;tidying your room&#39; is too big for you.</p> <p>What is the simplest thing you can do? How about you just get a trashbag. Done. Now, <strong>stop</strong>. Reduce again. Pick a surface area to clean. Stop. Remove all empty food containers from that surface and put into the trash. Stop. Shuffle your papers into a neat pile. Stop.</p> <p>That might be reduced to a ridiculous level for you, or it might not be reduced enough. But you get my point. The idea is that you are interrupting negative thought patterns and setting reasonable goals, and building a chain of positive emotion. You can&#39;t let yourself get carried away, otherwise you will start to panic and run away, like you always do.</p> <p>This isn&#39;t new, you&#39;ve probably been told to split a task into smaller chunks before. The problem is that advice is often given from a neurotypical, non-ADHD point of view. It doesn&#39;t take into account that task-splitting itself is a task that ADHD sufferers obsess over. That&#39;s why you need to <strong>stop</strong> first.</p> <p>You can use this to beat procrastination as well. Every time you start to worry about something you should be doing but aren&#39;t, repeat those words to yourself and reduce it to the bare minimum that you are <em>prepared</em> to do. Don&#39;t think about the end goal, just the current step.</p> <p>Maybe I&#39;m teaching you all to suck eggs. But for me, this has ended years of achieving nothing and feeling bad about stuff I need to do but won&#39;t. Hopefully it will do the same for you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jakomus90"> /u/jakomus90 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwocpf/method_stop_and_reduce/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwocpf/method_stop_and_reduce/">[comments]</a></span>
