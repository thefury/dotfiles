<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This is lengthy on purpose as I hope this detailed experience report will be helpful for others in Germany. For reference, 40+ female, based in Germany, public healthcare insured.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>On April 10 I mentioned that I may have ADD during a session with my psychologist. I&#39;ve been seeing the therapist for 2 years+ to treat PPD / returning depression.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Prior I had been talking to her about my supplement research. I was looking into supplements to help with my mood swings, concentration issues and forgetfulness because I had trouble at job interviews and was getting desperate as I was out of unemployment benefits and my savings were running out. I didn&#39;t want to apply for welfare which is a very lengthy, overly complicated and absolutely inhumane and degrading process over here. So always getting incited and not getting past the final round was what led me to frantically search for a solution.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>The supplements all indicated being beneficial for ADHD so I ended up here on Reddit. I immediately recognised my self in the challenges and descriptions of failures people shared here. Even more so here than on WebMD and similar pages.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Went to see my GP (Hausarzt) immediately after my session. The GP transferred me to a neuro psych.</p> <p>I was told to see an ADHD Specialist (ADHS Spezialist) which I was warned might take some time to find and might have 6+ weeks waiting time. If that was the case I would have been eligible to apply at my public insurance to seek a doctor who only takes &quot;Privatpatienten&quot;.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I consider myself extremely lucky that I found a specialist within one day of calling around and even located in my neighborhood with appointments available.</p> <p>I got an appointment for two weeks later and started to takes notes to describe my ADD fuck ups, symptoms and everything I remembered other people saying to me about me in the past. I also prepared a list of questions.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>First appointment was on April 26th and after 15 mins the neuro psych said she already new it was ADD. To get meds prescribed I needed to do a test first (im German it is called an ADS Test).</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Today (6 weeks later due to several public holidays and the doc being on vacation in May) was my diagnosis appointment.</p> <p>I had to fill out two questionnaires at home prior, bring my term reports from 2nd and 3rd grade if available, a blood screen to check for thyroid and other values and an ECG. I had done the screens only in March so was able to get a copy from my GP without any added stress (besides me going twice because I didn&#39;t read the referral paper properly and only asked for the blood screen the first time around).</p> <p>One questionnaire was a self diagnosis of my symptoms today and the other was a questionnaire in regards to my behaviour at 8 - 10 years. The childhood assessment was difficult for me since my mother claims I always was a quiet and well behaved child. I think I was quiet and easy in comparison to my extremely hyperactive brother who was put on Ritalin at 7 years old. That was an interesting realization.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>The doc said that according to the test results it was a close call and she didn&#39;t expect it to be so close herself. I told her that I didn&#39;t think the questionnaire asked the right questions and she agreed that these tests need to be updated. The questionnaire mainly focused on hyperactive symptoms which I don&#39;t really have to an extend that they would hinder me in my life. What it didn&#39;t focus on was the procrastination issues, the forgetfulness, the need for different stimulation such as interest, novelty, timely urgency, challenge.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Anyways, she prescribed me on a base dose of 10mg Medikinet Retard which is similar to Ritalin. She didn&#39;t prescribe Ritalin because there has been a shortage in Germany for several years.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I discussed my use of supplements with her to see if there were any concerns.</p> <p>She said she was very keen to see how Omega3 would work for me. She said she&#39;d recommend Krill Oil over vegan alternatives. She told me that parents of her ADHD child patients mention that Omega3 benefits them.</p> <p>Ginko she said would be worth a try but she hasn&#39;t really heard people say it helped.</p> <p>Silica (magnesium) and zink which I take for my rosacea she said was generally not bad to take.</p> <p>She warned me that St John&#39;s Wort can negate the effect of hormonal birth control and some antibiotics and advised I should always mention that I was taking it if I was to go to the dentist or emergency room so they could work around it.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>She said to her knowledge none of my supplements counter act with methylphenidate.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>The meds she prescribed are called Medikinet Retard. It is a methylphenidate, same as Ritalin, but has a different composition. It in part releases the active substance immediately and also has a component that is coated and hence acts delayed.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>The drug falls under BTMG (narcotics act) so my pharmacy didn&#39;t have it in storage but they will order it and have it ready for me this afternoon. The drug is fully covered by public health insurance in Germany and you only pay the usual max 10% deductible which was ‚Ç¨5 for a 52 capsule pack.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><strong>Sooo tomorrow is Day 1 and I am so excited!!!</strong></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>üòÅ</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><em>So this next part sort of became an acceptance speech. Sorry about that</em> üòÖ</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Today it is the first time in years that I feel like I&#39;m having a shot at a purposeful life again. Not just as a cog in a machine but actual someone who can live life.</p> <p>For years I was feeling as if bad luck was following me around because I just stumbled from one disaster to the next.</p> <p>There were times when it got worse and worse every week, either out of actual bad luck or because the shit I procrastinated about finally caught up all at once.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>Even my friends (those left over) were starting to believe in superstition and asked if I maybe got cursed on one of my backpacking journeys (I travelled a lot when I was younger).</p> <p>I even got dragged to see powerful Huichol and Mongolian shamans for cleansing and healing.</p> <p>My mom got me an Indian horoscope which says I am a manglik. Now check this: A manglik is a very unlucky person. Indians believe that manglik have such bad luck, you have to marry them to a tree or a pot so the bad luck doesn&#39;t rub off on their family.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>You see, at some point it made me so utterly desperate that I believed it was a curse. That maybe my ancestors did something bad or I did something in a past life if that exists.</p> <p>I tried to find out in a peyote ceremony but thanks to ADD I could not really focus and just had a fun trip with funky colors.</p> <p>Jeez I just realize that maybe the cactus did tell me that this was the issue but I got too distracted to notice. Lol.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><strong>Today it is the first time in a long time that I am feeling fortunate.</strong></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I finally know what was holding me back all these years. I finally can proactively do something to fullfill my potential. I finally know where to look for answers to help me work on living a happy life.</p> <p>Coincidentially I scheduled my therapy appointment for tomorrow morning. I will take the meds prior and I am curious to hear what the therapist will observe.</p> <p>Also my new job starts next week and now I even have a few days to get used to the meds or deal with the disappointment if they don&#39;t work for me.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>It just feels right now as if things are falling into place again. Like the universe finally pushed me on the right path.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><em>Ok, download complete.
