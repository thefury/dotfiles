<h2><a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/identity-access-management/oidc-auth">OpenID Connect (OIDC) Auth Method</a></h2>

<p>Vault clients must first authenticate with Vault to acquire a valid token. Vault 1.1 introduced support for OpenID Connect (OIDC) as an auth method which is provided by many authentication services such as Auth0.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/education-yh/screenshots/vault-oidc-6.png" height="340"></p>

<p>This guide walks through the configuration of the OIDC auth method using <strong><a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a></strong> as its OIDC provider.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-guides/tree/master/identity/oidc-auth">Vault OpenID Demo</a> for an example using Google OAuth.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.katacoda.com/hashicorp/scenarios/vault-agent">Katacoda Scenario: Vault Agent</a></h2>

<p>Vault Agent was first introduced in Vault 0.11 as a client daemon to automate the authentication and token lifecycle management. Vault 1.1 introduced its caching mechanism to further improve the efficiency of token and lease management.</p>

<p>This Katacoda scenario demonstrates both Auto-Auth and Caching of Vault Agent using the <code>approle</code> auth method. If you don&#39;t have a Vault environment, try the Katacoda interactive tutorial today!</p>
