<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m writing an article about how ADHD should get more recognition in (primary) education and how awareness of typical ADHD behaviour could improve school in favour of the teachers + other children as well as the children diagnosed with ADHD. I am about to write a part about how adressing certain behaviour from ADHD children can have an enormous impact on them.<br/> Ive noticed lots of people here alongside me have felt wrongly compared or judged in school. For example: &#39;&#39;Why can&#39;t you be like ___.&#39;&#39; or &#39;&#39;Why won&#39;t you just ___.&#39;&#39;<br/> My question is: If this has ever happened to you, how has it impacted you on a social/emotional level?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MisterMemeMan"> /u/MisterMemeMan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwqnvp/have_you_ever_felt_wrongly_comparedjudged_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwqnvp/have_you_ever_felt_wrongly_comparedjudged_in/">[comments]</a></span>
