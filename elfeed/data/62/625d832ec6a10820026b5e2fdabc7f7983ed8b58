<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>To provide in a little context. I (27M) have always felt like something was blocking my mind to work at it&#39;s full capacity. Like:</p> <ul> <li> I knew I was smarter than a lot of fellow students, but I always got average grades because I never managed to start studying in time or studying fully concentrated; </li> <li>I have a lot of interest in living a healthier lifestyle through sport and meditation, but never manage to stick to the regime more than a couple of days; </li> <li>I am one of the best sales people in my office, but I have low scores because I just can&#39;t motivate myself and/or focus on the boring parts of the job, like gathering leads. </li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m very easily distracted, talk a lot, my mind alway prefers the short term reward above the greater long term reward, and my head seems to be a jukebox when I try to sleep. I did multiple ADHD/ADD test (professional tests at a psychologist, and just some online stuff) that indicates really high levels of at least ADHD. However, I am so afraid.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen and read about how ADHD medication just flattens people off, or gets its patients hooked. In my country, Ritalin for example is even used as a party drug! It scares the shit out of me thinking that I basically have to choose between continuing living like this, or living dependent on farmaceutisch.</p> <p>Which advice would you give me? Who of you have had the same thoughts, and how did you deal with it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DutchNobody"> /u/DutchNobody </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwpfeu/im_new_here_and_im_pretty_insecure_about_it_all/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwpfeu/im_new_here_and_im_pretty_insecure_about_it_all/">[comments]</a></span>
