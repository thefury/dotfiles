<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After a history of transitioning from relationship to relationship and the end of my first serious one (living together, etc.) I decided that I should be single for a significant period of time, for myself, by myself. And what speeds up the break-up healing process? Casual dating! Or so I thought... looks fun when others do it. So I installed tinder for the first time and it&#39;s actually a nightmare, doesn&#39;t resemble the experience of my friends at all. </p> <p>First, I noticed that people I meet either interest me right away or not at all. I even tried having sex with someone who I found attractive but didn&#39;t interest me and it was a dull experience. </p> <p>Even worse with people who do interest me. Apparently, two dates is enough to get into the full ADHD-crush mode and want to text every day, not want to meet anyone else, have them on my mind all the time instead, well you know what I mean. Either 0 or 100. And the only way to end the obsession is getting a crush on someone else. I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my behaviour towards the person but it&#39;s my own feelings that give me massive stress and anxiety all the time and lock me down completely.</p> <p>So my question - is casual dating without suffering even possible when one has ADHD? Do you have ways to control your energy? Or just rule out casual dating at all? Does medicine help here? (I will start taking it soon).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/my_adhd_account"> /u/my_adhd_account </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwpp0h/casual_dating_and_having_adhd_how_do_you_do_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwpp0h/casual_dating_and_having_adhd_how_do_you_do_it/">[comments]</a></span>
