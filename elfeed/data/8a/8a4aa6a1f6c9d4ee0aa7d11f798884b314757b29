<p pid="2">As part of this article on <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/rest-api-security-vulnerabilities">REST API security vulnerabilities</a>,&nbsp;we have gone through a few types of vulnerabilities, and with this weekâ€™s post, we observe a few common concerns or causes that make our APIs vulnerable to various attacks. Also, at the end of this article, we will quickly dive into security tests that help expose vulnerabilities as part of regression tests.</p>
<h3 pid="4">API Design and Development Flaws&nbsp; </h3>
<p pid="5">Missing or non-adhering of API security principles and best practices may lead to defects that expose the business-critical data. As another aspect of design and development, we need to keep the APIs as simple as possible (less intricate) as complexity may lead to less coverage and being vulnerable. Inadequate user input validation, SQL injection loopholes, buffer overflows are a few other causes. Understanding and implementing various aspects of design strategies and RESTful API design practices in APIs helps reducing design and development flaws to a greater extent. </p>
