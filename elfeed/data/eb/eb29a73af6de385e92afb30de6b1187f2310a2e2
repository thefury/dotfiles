<p>Thank you all for reading the Enterprise Collection blog on Medium! We have now moved the blog to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/</a>, on the Amazon Web Services blog platform. Our blog is dedicated to the benefits and challenges enterprises encounter when trying to make the most of the cloud. What does the cloud-enabled enterprise look like? How can enterprises transform and reinvent themselves in the cloud, through changes to organizational culture, processes, people skills, bureaucratic rules, and organizational structures? Please join us for more discussion on the subject, at our new blog address. We look forward to seeing youÂ there!</p><p>Mark</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=89e9d89df64" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/aws-enterprise-collection/the-enterprise-strategy-blog-is-moving-89e9d89df64">The Enterprise Strategy blog is moving!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aws-enterprise-collection">AWS Enterprise Collection</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
