<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So my hyperfocus tends to manifest in the topic of the dayâ„¢ taking up real estate in my brain. I&#39;ll be able to do other tasks but my mind will always be on that topic and it&#39;ll be the only thing I&#39;ll want to talk about. Sometimes i do this with social situations where I&#39;ll be overthinking certain scenarios or outcomes and it makes my anxiety act up. It&#39;s kind of exhausting almost triggering an anxiety attack because you can&#39;t stop thinking about accidentally being rude or assuming your crush hates you cause they haven&#39;t texted you back. </p> <p>Is this common for anyone else? How do you guys deal with it? My next doctors appointment isn&#39;t till another two weeks and I desperately need a way to cope until then.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gabudaze"> /u/gabudaze </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwrdxe/hyperfocus_and_overthinking/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bwrdxe/hyperfocus_and_overthinking/">[comments]</a></span>
